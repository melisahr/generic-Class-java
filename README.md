# generic-Class-java

Followed along a YouTube video to learn on how to make a generic class. 
A generic class is able create one generic class instead of multiples of 
classes. The generic class can include different data types, such as, integer, double,
character, and string. The class has two generic parameters Thing and Thing2. The Thing
returns x, but this code will generate Thing2, y. It also contain bounded types, which 
allows a limited scope of refernce data types that can be send to a generic types.
The bounded type will extends Number, allowing only integer and double. The unaccepted
data type will be commented out.
